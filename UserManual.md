## Introduction

BuzzWord is an Android Scrabble Game Application that provides users an approach to easily practice for Scrabble by himself/herself. This would be a simpler, faster game, with some similarities to Scrabble, but without the original Scrabble board, allowing him/her to focus on weaknesses by adjusting the rules.

## Quick Start 

* **Step 1: Adjust Game Settings** <br>
Click the “SETTINGS” button to adjust game settings before starting a game. If you don’t adjust the game settings, the default settings or the setting you used in the last game will be applied to the new game. The game settings cannot be adjusted for the ongoing game. If you need to change the game settings while a game is in process, you have to end the current game first and then start a new game with the new settings.
* **Step 2: Play a Game** <br>
Click the “PLAY GAME” button to start a new game or return to the game in progress. Play the game by either making a word or swapping selected Rack Tiles in each turn. To make a word, one and only one tile from Board must be pulled to the Word Builder and one to seven tiles can be pulled from Rack to Word Builder. Then click the PLAY WORD button to submit the word you just made. To swap the selected Rack Tiles, pull only the tiles that need to be swapped from Rack to Word Builder. Then press the SWAP TILES button to swap the selected tiles. To reset the Board and Rack to the original status of the current turn, click the RESET TILES button. When a duplicated word is played, the current turn will be reset automatically. The game will end when the maximum turn is reached or when the pool is empty and the rack cannot be refilled. You can leave the game in process anytime by clicking the BACK button.
* **Step 3: Check Game Statistics** <br>
Click “STATISTICS” to check out the statistics for all the games, including game score statistics, letter statistics, and world bank statistics. Click the CLEAR STATS button to clear up all the statistics data as needed.
